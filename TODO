 + Write a binary, repacing "su -l" with itâ€™s own pam configuration name
 + create a hand-crafted array of sleep times instead of using an
   exponential increase.  This is to avoid silly steps like "2, 4, 8"
   and have something more meaningful instead like "0, 0, 30, 30, 60, 60"
 + log when the session is restarted
 + configure via preseeding
 + path is not good for root
 - split X options before passing them to xinit?  Is it needed or xinit does it?

Preseed values for testing:

nodm nodm/enabled boolean true
nodm nodm/user string root
nodm nodm/xinit string /usr/bin/time
nodm nodm/xsession string /bin/sleep
nodm nodm/x_options string 2
nodm nodm/min_session_time string 1
