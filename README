 * README for nodm

nodm is a minimal display manager that simply logs in as a given user and
starts an X session, without asking for username or password.

On a normal computer, using nodm is a big security issue because it would give
anyone access to the computer.

However, there are cases where automatic login is needed: for example in an
embedded system such as a mobile phone, or in a kiosk setup, or in a control
panel for industrial machinery.  For those cases, nodm is simple to setup,
lightweight, and it should do exactly the right thing.


 * Features

nodm is as small as it could be, and tries to provide the minimum amount of
features needed to do a good job, following as much as possible the principle
of least surprise.  This is what is offered:

 - Automatic login with a fixed user, doing all that needs to be done like
   setting up the session via PAM, updating lastlog, logging to syslog.
 - X is started via /usr/bin/xinit and a standard X session script (by default,
   /etc/X11/Xsession).
 - The session is restarted when it exits.
 - If a session exits too soon, nodm will wait a bit before restarting.  The
   waiting time go as follow:
    - The first time the session exits too soon, restart immediately
    - The second and third time, wait 30 seconds
    - All remaining times, wait 1 minute.
   Once a session lasts long enough, the waiting time goes back to zero.

nodm does NOT currently fork and run in the background like a proper daemon:
most distributions have tools that do that, and nodm plays just fine with them.
This is not a particular design choice: quite simply, so far no one has felt
the need to implement it.


 * Configuration

Configuration is made via 5 environment variables:

NODM_USER
  Controls the user that is used to automatically log in.

NODM_X_OPTIONS
  Options to pass to the X server (for example: "vt7 -nolisten tcp")

NODM_MIN_SESSION_TIME
  Minimum time (in seconds) that a session should last in order for nodm to
  decide that it has not quit too soon.  If an X session will run for less than
  this time, nodm will wait an increasing bit of time before restarting it
  (default: 60).

NODM_XINIT
  Path to the xinit program (default: /usr/bin/xinit)

NODM_XSESSION
  Path to the X session script (default: /etc/X11/Xsession)
