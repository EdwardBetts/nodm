.SH NAME
nodm \- X display manager for automatic logins
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nodm
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnodm\fP is a minimal display manager that simply logs in as a given user and
starts an X session, without asking for username or password.
.P
On a normal computer, using \fBnodm\fP is a big security issue because it would
give anyone access to the computer.
.P
However, there are cases where automatic login is needed: for example in an
embedded system such as a mobile phone, or in a kiosk setup, or in a control
panel for industrial machinery.  For those cases, \fBnodm\fP is simple to
setup, lightweight, and it should do exactly the right thing.
